# mav_shuttle

This repository contains scripts to implement the algorithms proposed in the following two papers:

Chen, Z., Li, X., & Zhou, X. (2019). Operational design for shuttle systems with modular vehicles under oversaturated traffic: Discrete modeling method. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 122, 1-19.

Chen, Z., Li, X., & Zhou, X. (2020). Operational design for shuttle systems with modular vehicles under oversaturated traffic: Continuous modeling method. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 132, 76-100.

A sample data set is provided to test the algorithms
